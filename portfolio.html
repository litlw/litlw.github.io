                                I wear many hats, and my education
                                was primarily in design and working
                                with new technology. As a UI / UX
                                designer, and a technology designer,
                                I have worked on a few projects.
                                This also includes projects for
                                other companies. <br><br>

                                My portfolio is made up of a range
                                of different projects. Some of it is
                                web cinema - using code and website
                                rendering techniques to develop a
                                narrative. Other parts are
                                interesting creations made of
                                hardware, data analyses, and making
                                something beautiful out of the
                                technology.

                                The best piece I have to offer is my
                                thesis (<em>honeybot</em>, 2019),
                                which is an attempt to teach a
                                little about digital security. The
                                intention was to give people who
                                have no education in security or
                                engineering a deep look at what's
                                happening on the web, and why
                                security matters to your every day
                                life experience.

                                    I wanted to build a machine that would be the subject of the attacks from the web. These attacks could actually show people what is going on. I think that a huge first step for teaching about what goes on “in the dark” is to just show it to them. I wanted to find a way to do that.
                                <br><br>
                                    First, I looked into a web manipulator, but almost immediately realized that it was too much of a risk on my computer and my personal network
                                    <br><br>    
                                    I consulted some coworkers who have significantly more experience in this field than myself. Thomas Jack, a network analyst and enthusiast for data security and privacy; and Brendan Vincelli, a talented developer and enthusiast for open source and the open data movement. Almost immediately they were excited to be a part of this experiment.
                                    <br><br>   
                                    Quickly they explained to me that a web browser going around acting naively is not actually a good example of how data privacy is breached or broken. A much better example would be to show how a server gets attacked.
